Problem:
pp = 7
qq = 7
rr = 2

pp = ((pp + pp) ^ ((pp + pp) % pp)) ^ (pp + pp)

if (pp and qq):
    pp = pp ^ pp
    qq = qq + qq

print(pp + qq + rr)
Output:
9
Explanation:
Initial values:
pp = 7, qq = 7, rr = 2

Compute new pp:

pp + pp = 14

(14 % 7) = 0

((14) ^ 0) ^ 14 = 14 ^ 14 = 0
So, pp = 0

Condition if (pp and qq) evaluates to False because pp is 0 (i.e., False in Boolean context), so the block is skipped.

Final values:
pp = 0, qq = 7, rr = 2

Final sum:
pp + qq + rr = 0 + 7 + 2 = 9
