Pseudocode:
1. Integer a
2. Set a = 1
3. while(a < 5)
4.     a = a + 2
5. end while
6. Print a
Step-by-step Execution:
Initially, a = 1

First iteration:

Condition: a < 5 → 1 < 5 → true

a = a + 2 → a = 3

Second iteration:

Condition: a < 5 → 3 < 5 → true

a = a + 2 → a = 5

Third iteration:

Condition: a < 5 → 5 < 5 → false → exit loop

✅ Final Answer:
The loop is executed 2 times.

Correct option: C. 2 ✅
